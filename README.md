# Uncertainty Quantification for DPD models
This project contains several use cases for the procedure of Bayesian inference of DPD parameters. The Bayesian inference and uncertainty quantification is carried using Korali, while the DPD simulations are performed using Mirheo.
The following use cases are covered:
1. Inference of DPD parameters to represent water, based on water viscosity as a funciton of density. Propagation of the uncertainty to prediction for other densities.
2. Hierarchical Bayesian inference of DPD parameters to represent water, based on its viscosity and isothermal compressibility.
